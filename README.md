# Welcome!

This is a simple todo list to test Remix!

## Environment variables

You must set `DATABASE_URL` pointing to your mysql database

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh

```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!
